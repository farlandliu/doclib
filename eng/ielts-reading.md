#Studying in Sydney, Australia
##Australia—Attractive to International Students
　　Australia has been a popular choice for thousands of international students over many years. Australia’s universities and colleges have become increasingly recognized overseas for their exceptionally high standard. In addition, Australia is conveniently close to South-East Asia (Jakarta, the capital of Australia’s closest Asian neighbor, Indonesia, is only 5506 kilometers from Sydney.) Revised entry procedures for overseas students have made it possible for an increasing number to study in Australia. Sydney the largest Australian city, is the principle port of call for international airlines with services operating to Australia.
##Sydney --- Location and History
　　Named after an ex-Governor of New South Wales, Sydney is the State’s capital city. Located on the south-east coast of Australia in the temperate zone, it enjoys a mild climate, averaging 14.5 hours of sunshine per day in summer and 10.25 hours in winter. It is also the largest, oldest and perhaps most beautifully situated city in Australia. First established by the British as a convict settlement in 1788, it is a modern cosmopolitan city that has developed into one of the nation’s major industrial, business, and manufacturing centre.
##The Harbour and Surrounding Suburbs
　　Sydney is home to nearly 4.4 million people (as of 1997). The suburbs reach out from the city centre and harbor some 55 km to the north, 35km to the west and 30 km to the south, creating a metropolitan area of about 3000 square kilometers. The 57 square kilometer harbor is one of the largest in the world, and famous for the unmistakable 134 meter high arch of the Harbor Bridge and the graceful sails of the Opera House. It is a busy waterway with ferries, freighters and pleasure craft.
##Residential Inner – City Suburbs
　　Not far from the city centre are the attractive old residential suburbs of Balmain, Glebe, and Paddington, where many people live in smart terraced houses. Art galleries, pubs, and restaurants abound in the cosy streets that tend to be quite narrow, whereas the suburbs surrounding the city’s colleges and universities consist mainly of family homes and multi-unit blocks – and ideal situation for students looking for a homestay, or to rent. Sydney’s newer suburbs now have a large multicultural population, and local shopping centres reflect the influences of many cultures.
##The Cultural Climate
　　Sydney is home to the State Art Gallery of New South Wales, the State Conservatorium of Music, the Australian Opera, the Sydney Dance Company, and the Australian Ballet. The world-class Sydney Symphony Orchestra offers superb classical music all year round. Local theatre is innovative and well-supported, and large-scale overseas productions tour regularly.
##Entertainment for Young and Old
　　As well as scores of cinemas and theatres throughout the city and suburbs, there are numerous clubs which appeal to people of all ages, and cater for all tastes. Pubs are the venue for smaller modern bands, while the big-name popular music artists, both local and international, attract capacity audiences at the huge Entertainment Centre in the heart of the city.
##Dining Out
　　In Sydney, a vast array of ethnic and local restaurants can be found to suit everybody. In summer, café patrons often sit outside at tables under umbrellas, and enjoy the passing parade of shoppers. Students who prefer to cook at home can choose from several large weekend markets, where fresh fruit, fish, and vegetables may be bought more cheaply than at the local supermarket. Sydney also has its own Chinatown.
##Shopper’s Delight
　　In the heart of the city are several big department stores linked by enclosed over-the-street crossings and underground walkways. Most noticeable are the towering Centrepoint complx and the Queen Victoria Building, both containing many shopping arcades, coffee shops and restaurants. Out of town, in the suburbs, there are huge regional shopping centres. At the weekend markets, bargains can be had when shopping for clothing as well as for a wide range of assorted goods.
##Sporting Facilities
　　Australia is recognized as one of the most sports-conscious nations in the world. Sydney boasts an impressive number of facilities for all types of indoor and outdoor sporting activities. Wherever one goes, there are golf courses, cricket pitches, football ovals, tennis and squash courts, and, of course, indoor and outdoor swimming pools. Avid ice-skating and ten-pin bowling fans will find that these activities are also popular and inexpensive.

warning:
MONDAYS ARE BAD
FOR YOUR HEART
a that monday morning feeling, could be a crushing
pain in the chest which leaves you sweating and
gasping for breath. recent research from germany
and italy shows that heart attacks are more common
on monday morning and doctors blame the stress of
returning to work after the weekend break.
b the risk of having a heart attack on any given
day should be one in seven, but a six-year study
coordinated by researchers at the free university of
Berlin of more than 2,600 germans revealed that the
average person had a 20 per cent higher chance of
having a heart attack on a monday than on any other
da
c working germans are particularly vulnerable,
with a 33 per cent higher risk at the beginning of the
king week. non-workers, by
to be no more at risk on a monday than any other
day
d a study of 11,000 italians identified 8 am on a
Monday morning as the most stressful time for the
heart, and both studies showed that sunday is the
least stressful day, with fewer heart attacks in both
countries
e the findings could lead to a better understanding
of what triggers heart attacks, according to dr . stefan
Willich of the free university.we know a lot about
long-term risk factors such as smoking and cholesterol
but we dont know what actually triggers heart
attacks, so we cant make specific recommendations
about how to prevent them , he said
f monday mornings have a double helping of stress
for the working body as it makes a rapid transition
from sleep to activity, and from the relaxing weekend
to the pressures of work.whe
le get up, thei
blood pressure and heart rate go up and there are
hormonal changes in their bodies,
All these things can have an adverse effect in the blood
system and increase the risk of a clot in the arteries
which will cause a heart attack when people return to
work after a weekend off the pace of their life changes.
They have a higher workload, more stress, more anger
and more physical activity, said willich. we need to
know how these events cause changes in the body
before we can understand if they cause heart attacks
But although it is tempting to believe that
urning to work increases the risk of a heart attack
both willich and the italian researchers admit that
it is only a partial answer. both studies showed
that the over-65s are also vulnerable on a monday
morning even though most no longer work. the
reason for this is not clear but the italian team at the
Luigi saddo hospital in milan speculate that social
interactions-the thought of facing another week
and all its pressures--may play a part
h what is clear, however, is that the monday
morning peak seems to be consistent from northern
Germany to southern italy in spite of the differences
in diet and lifestyle
/ willich is reluctant at this stage to make specific
recommendations, but he suggests that anyone who
suffers from heart disease should take it easy on
Monday mornings and leave potentially stressful
meetings until midweek.people should try to create
a pleasant working environment, he added . maybe
this risk applies only to those who see work as a
burden, and people who enjoy their work are not so
much at risk. we need to find out more
